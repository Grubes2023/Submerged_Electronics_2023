This will be version 2 of the Hello World (Blinking LED) Program

This version will include 2 inputs (2 buttons)
When Button A is pushed, two LEDs will begin to oscillate out of phase with each other
Button A acts as an ON switch therefore.

Button B will act the opposite (as an off switch)

For grins a 3rd button may be added as an individual of switch for one of the LEDs


This program will solve: Output GPIO process
                         Input GPIO process
                         Basic Input Logic
                         For Loops
                         IF/Else statements
